A.  
The disk rpm is a must-have component of a hard drive's performance because it impacts the latency and the disk transfer rate. Latency is the average time for the sector being accessed to rotate into position under a head. While the transfer rate of the disk is the speed at which data is transferred to and from the disk media and its recording data.
