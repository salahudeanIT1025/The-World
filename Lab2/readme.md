Hard Drives and Memory:

A.  
The disk rpm is a must-have component of a hard drive's performance because it impacts the latency and the disk transfer rate. Latency is the average time for the sector being accessed to rotate into position under a head. While the transfer rate of the disk is the speed at which data is transferred to and from the disk media and its recording data. 

B.  
Traditional hard drives use mechanical spinning platters, heads, magnetic surfaces, spindles, and other complex stuff that solid hard drives don’t deal with. Solid state hard drives don’t have to wait for a disk to spin (latency of the disk) instead contents can be used immediately. Solid state hard drives also store data on instantly accessible memory chips.

Without a high amount of RAM data constantly swaps out and in of the swapping file in the hard drive causing your computer to work slower, but with higher ram this problem is resolved by increasing the speed of operations on your computer.
