# Hardware
Hard Drives and Memory:

A.  
The disk rpm is a must-have component of a hard drive's performance because it impacts the latency and the disk transfer rate. Latency is the average time for the sector being accessed to rotate into position under a head. While the transfer rate of the disk is the speed at which data is transferred to and from the disk media and its recording data. 

B.  
Traditional hard drives use mechanical spinning platters, heads, magnetic surfaces, spindles, and other complex stuff that solid hard drives don’t deal with. Solid state hard drives don’t have to wait for a disk to spin (latency of the disk) instead contents can be used immediately. Solid state hard drives also store data on instantly accessible memory chips.

i.  
Without a high amount of RAM data constantly swaps out and in of the swapping file in the hard drive causing your computer to work slower, but with higher ram this problem is resolved by increasing the speed of operations on your computer. 


ii.  
The big difference is that a 64-bit processor can use and handle more data than a 34-bit processor. A 64-bit processor can access over 4 billion times as much as a 35-bit processor. A 64-bit can hold a lot more ram while a 35-but has a limited amount of ram it can hold. After doing a little more research a 64-bit system can access 2^64 different memory addresses. A 32- bit system can only access 2^32 different memory addresses. 
# ALU and Control Unit
The ALU is a digital circuit used to perform arithmetic and logical operations. The control unit tells the ALU what operations to perform on the data, and the ALU stores the results in an output register. The control unit moves the data between these registers, the ALU, and the memory. 
# CPU, Input, and Output
The central processing unit or the CPU for short would be the computer used to check out your food or essential needs would have a CPU inside it. Inside that check out machine the CPU stores data of the purchased products, and calculates everything bought.
The Input is the products being scanned and converts the physical input to binary information this also would be the memory which stores the data. The touch screen of that self checkout machine could be the input. 
Once the CPU is done processing the data, it often needs to output a result. The output device would be the computer/monitor you look at while scanning your products.
# Logic Gates and Circuits
A truth table is a table that shows the operations logically on input signals in a table chart/ format. The NAND gate and an AND gate Both have the logical inverse of the OR gate. 
# IEEE-Ethically Aligned Design
IEEE stands for the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineering. They are dedicated to advancing innovation and technological excellence for the benefit of humanity. Their roots go back to 1884 when electricity showed its head for the first time. IEEE can be compared to NASA in the electrical, computing, and electronic advances made throughout the many years. Ethics in device design is very important because it keeps design clean,honest, and fair. All people and members on a board must give the final device a go for production. 

# Data Representation
# Numeric Conversation

A.  
Decimals can be any number using ten digits, that would mean using numbers 0-9. Binary numbers represent numbers using two digit 0-1. A hexadecimal number represents any number using ten digits and six characters.
