 Data Transmission-   
 
A protical is an established set of rules that determine how data is transmitted between different devices in the same network. Essentially, it allows connected devices to communicate with each other, regardless of any differences in their internal processes, structure or design. Packet is the fundamental unit of data transmitted over the Internet. When a host intends to send a message to another host, it breaks the message down into smaller pieces, called packets. Packet switching data packets are first assembled and then numbered. They then travel across a predefined route, sequentially.  Every device on the Internet is assigned a unique identifying number called an IP address. DNS stands for “domain name server or system.” DNS acts as the directory of websites on the Internet. When a request to access a host with a domain name is given, a DNS server is queried. It returns the IP address of the host requested, allowing for proper routing.

 Networking Hardware-  
 
A.  
A switch is more intelligent than a hub. As a hub, a switch is the connection point for the computers in a network. However, a switch is more efficient at passing along traffic. It records the addresses of the computers connected to it in a table.

B.  
Hubs and switches allow the connection of multiple components to form a local area network while routers are needed for bridging computers and peripherals on a local network to another network or the Internet.

A.  
A single point of failure is any non-redundant part of a system that, if dysfunctional, would cause the entire system to fail. A single point of failure is antithetical to the goal of high availability in a computing system or network, a software application, a business practice, or any other industrial system.  

B.  
Wireless Mesh has a simple component that conects with no wires and can be more expensive.  Infrastructure Topology is not as expensive and uses cables to transfer internet and data. i would rather have the Wireless Mesh because less likely some accident could occure causing you to lose data.
