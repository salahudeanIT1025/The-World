# Executive Summary 
We learned about lucid charts which were very straightforward and easy to use. Also talked about data transmission and many key terms to show how data is transmitted. Then I learned about data networks that had a few systems that were new to me. Then lastly we learned about cyber security and cryptology. I really dont have too much to say as most the info was very easy to read and do.

# Introduction to Networking 
 Data Transmission-   
 
A protical is an established set of rules that determine how data is transmitted between different devices in the same network. Essentially, it allows connected devices to communicate with each other, regardless of any differences in their internal processes, structure or design. Packet is the fundamental unit of data transmitted over the Internet. When a host intends to send a message to another host, it breaks the message down into smaller pieces, called packets. Packet switching data packets are first assembled and then numbered. They then travel across a predefined route, sequentially.  Every device on the Internet is assigned a unique identifying number called an IP address. DNS stands for “domain name server or system.” DNS acts as the directory of websites on the Internet. When a request to access a host with a domain name is given, a DNS server is queried. It returns the IP address of the host requested, allowing for proper routing.

 Networking Hardware-  
 
A.  
A switch is more intelligent than a hub. As a hub, a switch is the connection point for the computers in a network. However, a switch is more efficient at passing along traffic. It records the addresses of the computers connected to it in a table.

B.  
Hubs and switches allow the connection of multiple components to form a local area network while routers are needed for bridging computers and peripherals on a local network to another network or the Internet.

A.  
A single point of failure is any non-redundant part of a system that, if dysfunctional, would cause the entire system to fail. A single point of failure is antithetical to the goal of high availability in a computing system or network, a software application, a business practice, or any other industrial system.  

B.  
Wireless Mesh has a simple component that conects with no wires and can be more expensive.  Infrastructure Topology is not as expensive and uses cables to transfer internet and data. i would rather have the Wireless Mesh because less likely some accident could occure causing you to lose data.  

Network design-  
Wasnt anything crazy to create or comprehend and wasn't difficult. its just a tropology thats connected to computers and printer.

NSA/CSS-  
The agency's mission is to protect the formulation of ciphers, code and all cryptology for the US military and other government agencies, They also do interception, analysis and solution of coded transmission.
# Cybersecurity and Encryption
Information Systems Security-  
A.  
Confidentiality is impactful to the job because you do not want the wrong people learning they can abuse a certain system or gain access to a program they should not be allowed to have. Integrity is important because you do not want to give out the wrong or altered information because it could cause many problems with your public image as a company. Lastly, availability is impactful because if Amazon were to go down it would stop a lot of business and halt millions of dollars worth of business so this is important because they need to be available at all times as one of the top retailers in the world. 

B.  
Three daily tasks that require authentication are something they know, something they have, or something they are. This all ties into multi-factor authentication because it would be near impossible to misrepresent or steal an identity if you were to just guess these. 

C.  
ACL is the access control list and it makes sure you only have access to the correct areas that you are permitted to use. RBAC is role based access control and it makes it so that roles are assigned to users and then those roles are assigned to certain access points. The disadvantages of ACL are "the primary drawback is that each information resource is managed separately, so if a security administrator wanted to add or remove a user to a large set of information resources, it would be quite difficult. And as the number of users and resources increase, ACLs become harder to maintain". The disadvantage of RBAC is that if a user has multiple roles this could cause a problem within the system because it is going to try and figure out where you should be placed and could cause errors.

D.  
We need public cryptography because it allows us to send our public keys to our allies and having an allies public key allows messages to be decrypted.

Cryptography-  
B.  
Typing the message "cryptography is growing fast" and then turning the wheel makes it so that the starting letter which is A because for example the second letter which is B and so on and so forth. So my A would be B and B would be C but this tool allows you to choose how many places you want to send it.

C.  
Typing the second message "Frequency Fingerprint Exploration" is the same thing, you choose how many places you want to offset the letters and the message becomes encrypted. In the case of different languages it would just change from English to their respected alphabetical and numerical system.

D.  
A polyalphabetic cypher is a much harder form of cypher where a secret shift word is changed to numbers according to their position in the alphabet, next the sequence of numbers is repeated in the message, then each letter is shifted according to the below it. 

E.  
Typing the final message is the same because the box has not changed so the encryption method will not change.
# Brute-Force
Brute force attack is when every possible decryption key is used for a cipher in an attempt to unlock it. It relates to Kerckhoffs's principle because even though they will try every method until it has been unlocked, a cipher should still be secure even if they have the key because the part of the cipher that keeps the message secret is the key itself.

 # Conclusion 
 In conclusion figuring out what each term was about and understanding it was a lot easier than the last lab. I really don’t have too much to say because everything was easy and straightforward. The website was cool and again not difficult to use.
