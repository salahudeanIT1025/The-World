# Executive summary
I learned that Github is the main staple site for coders and producers. I also learned why github is and used for. I created a acount on Github, at firt I was confused and very nervous startin g up Github because it was a very different territory, but as I learnd things got easier. I learned how to take screen shots from google images and put them into Github. The steps learned in  this weeks lesson will assist me in getting my college degree in IT.
# Information system components
I use my car almost everyday and it is a Information system that store all data when being used. This system uses data from the acceleration of the vehicle to the engine itself. the data from the car can help people create and benefit from the results of the car. the car also help other IT object/Machines benefit from its data being tranfered. some things that benefit ar gas pumps, stop lights, and many more.
# Git Hub
On the client-side it was more private and runs on a clients or users device. while on the server-side you create code for online servers/websites behind the scenes and usually focus on creating the websites content unlike client-side who usually work on visual effects. Githubs desktop shows the pros of using the app/website to learn code and lear abot IT. Gethub is connected to multipe people through the internet creating a simple and easy way to learn. Github is considered cloud computing because multiple users saved data and code is stored. Also Github allows you to share data to other people and devices. One cloud computing example would be gmail i use it very often.
# Conclution
Lab one taught me what IT was and the benefits of IT. It also introduced me to Client-Servers and helped me understand what they are. Github is also a great plattform to learn coding material and use for IT classes.
