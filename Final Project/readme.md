# Executive Summary
I decided to do option two and do the Implementation side instead of the Research side. I created code on a website called 

### Project
I decided to go with a simpler aprouch and create a ATM of some sort. My fisrt thought was to create a robot or Ai like Siri or Echo, but after doing research and seeing that this could be very complicated i created code for ATM machine instead. I did do additional research and found some examples to use of the internet to better help the effect I was ultimitley going for. So the code i created was pretty basic and pretty much asks the person how much money would you like out. Then the person puts in  the amount they want in there savings account. Then if that person is done it goes back to the home screen and if the individual is not then the ATM will run again.

# Conclution
This course wasnt super hard but it also wasnt easy. Throught this course I over thought on project that should have been easy to do. I would recomend you first find out what your gettinng yourself into. Even though i struggled quite abit on this course i found it vey needed to go into any industry where computers, codes, and systems will be needed. My next step is to transfer and either further my path in IT or choose an alternative path that fits me best (Accounting).
