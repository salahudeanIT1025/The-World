# Python IDLE
D.  
Python Shell is a command line tool that starts up the python interpreter. You can test simple programs and also write some short programs. However, in order to write a more complexed python program you need an editor. IDLE, on the other hand, has combined the above two needs and bundled them as a package
# Code Examples 
I.  
A variable is like a box in the computerâ€™s memory where you can store a single value. Authors use the variable names spam, bacon and eggs because, its easier to find no errors in these types of variables.

II.  
You use Python assignment statements to assign objects to names. for example Value = Sal(3).

III.  
A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. A function can return data as a result. An example would be def my_function():            print("Hello from a function")

IV.  
The Integer, Floating-Point, and String Data Types ar the three data types. A data type is a category for values, and every value belongs to exactly one data type. Numbers with a decimal point, such as 3.14, are called floating-point numbers. stringers are the text values of a python program. a single quotation mark surounds your stringers. 
# Graphics 
Raster vs. Vector Graphics-        
The difference between a raster image and a vector image is that, a raster image when enlarged or reduced in size start blurring. Vector is the complete oposite when enlarged or reduced in size the image stays the same. if your zoomed in on google maps and are on the streets you want to use vectors image, but if your zoomed out and dont wanna see the trees just the USA map then you might like rater graphics.   

Lossless vs. Lossy Compression-  
The advantages of lossless compretion is no loss of quality, slight decreases in image file size and the disadvantages are larger files than if you were to use lossy compression.
Lossy compretion have none of the advantages that lossless compretion does.

File Formats-  
JPEG works best for storing full-color images full of complex shading and color variation and allows the desighner to fine tune the amount of compretion used. PNG is mostly superior to GIF, as it is newer, supports more colors, and is free of patent restriction, but GIFs format allows for animated images. PNG cannot be used for animation, but offers highly sophisticated transparency and color support, among other features.

File Properties-  
I made a new iphone that i use quite alot actually. i used blue behind the iphone because its a color i associate with iphone and my iphones white so i went with the opposite instead. I only used 1 layer.
