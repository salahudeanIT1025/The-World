# Python IDLE
D.  
Python Shell is a command line tool that starts up the python interpreter. You can test simple programs and also write some short programs. However, in order to write a more complexed python program you need an editor. IDLE, on the other hand, has combined the above two needs and bundled them as a package
# Code Examples 
I.  
A variable is like a box in the computerâ€™s memory where you can store a single value. Authors use the variable names spam, bacon and eggs because, its easier to find no errors in these types of variables.

II.  
You use Python assignment statements to assign objects to names. for example Value = Sal(3).

III.  
A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. A function can return data as a result. An example would be def my_function():            print("Hello from a function")

IV.  
The Integer, Floating-Point, and String Data Types ar the three data types. A data type is a category for values, and every value belongs to exactly one data type. Numbers with a decimal point, such as 3.14, are called floating-point numbers. stringers are the text values of a python program. a single quotation mark surounds your stringers.
