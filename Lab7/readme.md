# File Compression
A.   
It is a process in which the size of a file is reduced by re-encoding the file data to use fewer bits of storage than the original file.

B.   
JPEG is a faster image format and uses lossy compression algorithm and image may lost some of its data whereas SVG is a text based image format and uses mathematical structures to represent a image and is highly scalable.
# Object Oriented Programming
i.   
Methods are a special kind of function that are defined within a class. The method and property would be shark.

ii.  
The constructor method is used to initialize data an it runs as soon as an object of a class is instantiated.

iii.   
Classes are useful because they allow us to create many similar objects based on the same blueprint. Classes make it possible to create more than one object following the same pattern without creating each one from scratch. Use inheritance to create child classes from a parent class.

# Unified Modeling Language
i.   
OMG is an international, open membership, not-for-profit technology standards consortium, founded in 1989. OMG Task Forces develop enterprise integration standards for a wide range of technologies and an even wider range of industries. he Unified Modeling Language (UML) was created to forge a common, semantically and syntactically rich visual modeling language for the architecture, design, and implementation of complex software systems both structurally and behaviorally. 

ii.  
The objest would be the name of the shark which is sammy because it represent an entity and the basic building block. The class would be shark because its the blue print of an object. The Abstraction would be swim(self) because its the behavior of a real world entity. The Encapsulation would be a specific type of shark because it said, mechanism of binding the data together and hiding them from outside world. The Inheritance would be the definition of a shark because it said, mechanism of making new classes from existing one.
