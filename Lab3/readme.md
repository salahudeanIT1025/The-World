A.  
i. Software is created by developers through the process of programming and without software, the hardware would not be functional. Operating systems manage the hardware and create the interface between the hardware and the user. an example of an operating system would be Microsoft Windows.

Data virtualization is an approach to data management that allows an application to retrieve and manipulate data without requiring technical details about the data. In Virtualization, a user gets dedicated hardware while in Cloud computing multiple hardware devices provide one login environment for the user.

# Python
A.  
Python pseudocode is more like an algorithmic representation of the code involved. This means when a code is expected to be formulated it cannot be directly drafted. The code will need to be first generated into a Python pseudocode and then it needs to be formulated into an actual code.

B.    
A program written in a compiled language like C or C++ is converted from the source language i.e. C or C++ into a language that is spoken by your computer (binary code) using a compiler with various flags and options. Internally, Python converts the source code into an intermediate form called bytecodes and then translates this into the native language of your computer and then runs it.
