# Executive Summary

# Software
A.  
i. Software is created by developers through the process of programming and without software, the hardware would not be functional. Operating systems manage the hardware and create the interface between the hardware and the user. an example of an operating system would be Microsoft Windows. Application software performs specific tasks such as word processing, accounting, database management, video games, or browsing the web. Utility software helps users configure, analyse, optimise and maintain a computer.

ii. the ERP software stands for Enterprise Resource Planning and is a system that was developed to bring together an entire organization within one program. ERP software utilizes a central database that is implemented throughout the entire organization. one example of a ERP is Microsoft.

B.  
Data virtualization is an approach to data management that allows an application to retrieve and manipulate data without requiring technical details about the data. In Virtualization, a user gets dedicated hardware while in Cloud computing multiple hardware devices provide one login environment for the user.

# Virtualization
B.  
i. Virtualization allows you to use a physical machine’s full capacity by distributing its capabilities among many users or environments. Some problems that are solved with virtulization are Resource Distribution, VM Sprawl, Backward Compatibility, and Performance Monitoring just to name a few.  

ii. Hypervisors separate the physical resources from the virtual environments—the things that need those resources to make virtualization possible. Hypervisors take your physical resources and divide them up so that virtual environments can use them.

# Python
A.  
Python pseudocode is more like an algorithmic representation of the code involved. This means when a code is expected to be formulated it cannot be directly drafted. The code will need to be first generated into a Python pseudocode and then it needs to be formulated into an actual code.

B.    
A program written in a compiled language like C or C++ is converted from the source language i.e. C or C++ into a language that is spoken by your computer (binary code) using a compiler with various flags and options. Internally, Python converts the source code into an intermediate form called bytecodes and then translates this into the native language of your computer and then runs it. 
# Career Exploration
CollegeCentral.  
I found many jobs that are avalable at actually pay pretty well a few jobs i saw and took a closer look at was IT Security Analyst Professional Apprentice, Videographer/Editor/Photographer, and Brand Ambassador just to name a few.

4.   Bureau of Labor Statistics is a site thats pretty much a occupational outlook handbook. It basically a accurate wikipedia that tells you the highs and lowes of your preffered ocupation. I looked at advertising and IT related searches and became very intrested in them.

Certifications:  
A.
CompTIA is the only intermediate high-stakes cybersecurity analyst certification with both hands-on, performance-based questions and multiple-choice questions. Also covers the most up-to-date core security analyst skills and upcoming job skills used by threat intelligence analysts, application security analysts, compliance analysts, incident responders/handlers, and threat hunters, bringing new techniques for combating threats inside and outside of the Security Operations Center (SOC). 

B.  
pretty much the same as the first site, but a smig easier to handle and straight forward. It created a path I wanted to go and didnt force me down the path.

C.  
Was about becoming certified information systems security professional and was kind of hard to look around. This wasnt my favorite cite of the bunch at all.

6. the one that intrested me the most was the Data Analytics. 

Co-ops / Internships:  
To become co-op ready upload your resume for final revisions and approval by a Career Coach at Handshake

The Benefits of going into a internship or co-op partnership is that it gives you a working experience on a job you would like to pursue in the near future.

Industry Associations / Student Organizations

C.   
The IEEE is the world's largest technical professional organization for the advancement of technology. IEEE and its members inspire a global community through its highly cited publications, conferences, technology standards, and professional and educational activities and I want to be apart of that community. Its main purpose is to advance technology for the greater benefit of humanity.
